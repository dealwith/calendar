# Potential Pipeline

## Overview
The proposed CI/CD pipeline will manage the process of integrating code changes, running automated tests, and deploying the application to production. The pipeline will be set up for both the frontend and backend components of the application.

## Tools and Services
Source Control: GitHub (or similar like GitLab, Bitbucket)

CI/CD Platform: GitHub Actions (alternatives: GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins, CircleCI)

Hosting Services:

Frontend: Vercel (alternatives: Netlify, AWS S3 + CloudFront)

Backend: Heroku (alternatives: AWS Elastic Beanstalk, DigitalOcean App Platform)

## Pipeline Stages
1. Source Control Management
Use a Git-based version control system (like GitHub) to manage the codebase.
Adopt a branching strategy (e.g., feature branching, GitFlow) suitable for your team's workflow.

2. Continuous Integration
- Automated Testing:
Implement automated tests (unit tests, integration tests) for both frontend and backend.
Configure CI tools to run these tests on every push to the repository or pull request.
- Code Quality Checks:
Integrate code linters and formatters (e.g., ESLint, Prettier) to enforce coding standards.
Optionally, include static code analysis tools for additional code quality checks.

3. Continuous Deployment

- Frontend Deployment:
	Configure Vercel (or similar) for automated deployment of the frontend.
	Deployments should be triggered on merges to the main branch.
	Consider setting up preview deployments for pull requests.

- Backend Deployment:
Set up Heroku (or similar) for automated deployment of the backend.
Use environment variables in Heroku to manage configuration settings.
Automatic deployments can be triggered on merges to the main branch.
Consider using Docker for containerized deployment, if necessary.

4. Monitoring and Alerts

- Implement monitoring tools (e.g., Sentry, LogRocket) to track errors and performance issues.

- Set up alerts for any critical issues that need immediate attention.

- Security Considerations. Ensure sensitive data like API keys and secret tokens are stored securely using environment variables or secret management tools.

- Regularly update dependencies to mitigate vulnerabilities.
